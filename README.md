# Git Utils

`git-utils` is yet another Git wrapper (yes, I thought about calling it `yag` or something similar, but that joke's a little played out, I think).  So why another Git wrapper?  Mainly because I looked at all the existing ones and they didn't do what I need, and I didn't feel that they were well-suited for contribution.  Which is why I'm rollign my own.  My goals are:

* Extremely easy to create new functions.
* Write one (synchronous) function, and the framework will automatically generate sync and (promise-based) async versions.
* Fast, easy unit testing.

More documentation to come...this project is just getting off the ground.
